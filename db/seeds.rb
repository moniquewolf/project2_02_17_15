Post.create(title: 'Coconut Quinoa Pancakes', body: '(recipe from At Home in the Whole Food Kitchen by Amy Chaplin)  
Makes ten 4-inch / 10 cm pancakes
1/2 cup / 85 g uncooked quinoa, soaked for 12 to 24 hours in 1 cup filtered water  1/2 cup / 45 g rolled oats 3/4 cup / 60 g unsweetened desiccated coconut 1 cup /250 ml unsweetened almond milk 1 egg or 1 tsp chia seeds soaked in 1/4 cup filtered water for 15 minutes  2 tbsp melted extra virgin coconut oil (more for cooking)  1/2 tsp ground vanilla 1 tsp baking powder  1/2 tsp cinnamon  zest of 1 lemon
Drain and rinse quinoa, and place it in an upright blender. Add oats, ¼ cup coconut, almond milk, chia egg (or regular egg), coconut oil, vanilla, baking powder, and cinnamon. Blend on high speed for about 40 seconds or until completely smooth, scraping down sides as necessary. Add remaining coconut and lemon zest and stir with a rubber spatula to combine.
Warm a wide cast iron skillet over medium heat; add about 1 teaspoon coconut oil and spoon in ¼ cup batter for each pancake. Spread the batter out a little with the back of a spoon to make a 4-inch pancake. Cook for about 3 minutes or until surface is covered with bubbles and bottom is golden and beginning to brown. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from skillet and repeat with remaining batter.
These pancakes are best hot off the pan, but they can also be kept warm in a 200ºF / 90°C oven as you cook the whole batch. Serve with Quick Citrus Chia Jam or fresh fruit and a dash of maple syrup.
Quick Citrus & Chia Jam  5 mandarins or citrus fruits of choice, peeled and most of the white rim discarded  2 tbsp honey or maple syrup (more or less depending on the sweetness of the citrus fruits)  1-2 tbsp chia seeds
Peel two of the mandarins and chop the slices into small pieces that you place in a small bowl. Cut the remaining mandarins in half and squeeze out all the juice into the bowl. Add honey and chia seeds. Use a fork to whisk until all is combined. Leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight, whisk once or twice to prevent the chia seeds form forming lumps. The chia seeds will bind the juice into a jam-like consistency. Store in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to 3-5 days.

Post.create(title: 'Summer Salad', body:'Beetroot, Zucchini & Apple Salad
Serves 6 persons

This is a very light salad, suitable for hot summer days. The zucchini is grilled, but everything else is raw – even the beets – which gives it a very fresh taste and crunchy texture. Top it with macadamia nuts, Queso Manchego and herb dressing.

1 medium size zucchini
100 g macadamia nuts
3 apples
3 Chioggia beets
3 beetroots
100 g rucola
50 g Manchego cheese 

Herb & Mustard Dressing
1/2 cup olive oil 
4 tbsp white vine vinegar
1/3 cup fresh herbs
1 tbsp dijon mustard
1 clove garlic
salt & pepper to taste

Preparing the vegetables: Wash the zucchini and cut it in ½ -inch slices. Grill them for about 1 minute on each side and set aside. Roast the macadamia nuts in pan on medium heat for a couple of minutes. Wash the apples and peel and rinse the Chioggia beets and beetroots. Slice them all as thin as you can.

Preparing The Herb & Mustard Dressing: Put all ingredients in a mixer or blender and mix until you get a smooth sauce. Taste.

Assembling the layers: Place a slice of apple, a slice of beetroot, a slice of grilled zucchini, a slice of Chioggia beet and some rucola leafs on top of each other. Repeat three more times.

Post.create(title: 'Kimichi Wraps', body: 'If you for some reason haven’t heard of Kimchi before, we recommend that you immediately add it to the list of things you need to try. It is a fermented spicy korean cabbage salad with a very intriguing and wonderful flavor – a kind of pleasantly sour and pungent taste. It is probably the most famous ingredient in the Korean kitchen. It is also one of David’s favorite things to eat – all categories. Apart from its flavor, it also has several health benefits. Day 1
2 lbs / 1 kg Napa cabbage
2 tbsp coarse sea salt

Day 2
60 ml / 4 tbsp rice vinegar
3 tbsp Korean chili flakes or powder (buy in asian stores)
2 tbsp unpastorized honey
2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
3 spring onions, sliced in bite-size pieces

Prepare the cabbage by removing the outer leafs, slice lengthwise half, then again in quarters. Remove the core and cut into 2 inch / 5 cm pieces. Place cabbage in a large non-reactive bowl, sprinkle with salt and toss well to combine. Place a smaller plate on top and a heavy bowl or books to weigh down. Set a side for 24 hours.

Rinse the cabbage well in cold water to remove the salt and squeeze out the excess water. Mix rice vinegar, chili, honey, ginger and spring onions in a large bowl. Then add the cabbage and toss well to combine, use your hands or a wooden spoon. When mixed, place in a glass jar or crock pot, close the lid and leave in room temperature for 2-3 days. Then place in the fridge for 4 days before you can eat it. If you don’t open the jar you can keep it in the fridge for weeks (probably months).

Pickled Cucumber Salad
Day 1
1 cucumber
1 tbsp coarse sea salt

Day 2
1 spring onion, thinly sliced
1 tsp garlic, minced
1 tbsp Korean chili flakes or powder (buy in asian stores)
1 tsp unpastorized honey
2 tsp rice vinegar

Wash the cucumber and cut lengthwise in half, then thinly slice. Place in a small non-reactive bowl, sprinkle with salt and toss well to combine. Place a smaller plate on top to weigh down (no need to place something heavy on top). Set a side for at least an hour.

Rinse the cucumber well in cold water to remove the salt. Now add onion, garlic, chili, honey and vinegar and toss well to combine, use your hands or a wooden spoon.When mixed, place in a glass jar, close the lid and place in the fridge for 1-2 days. Ready to eat.

Sesame Marinated Baby Spinach
200 g fresh baby spinach 
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil 
1 tbsp rice vinegar 
1 tbsp soy sauce 
1 tsp honey 
1 tsp minced garlic 
1 spring onion, very thinlysliced

Rinse the baby spinach and place in medium mixing bowl. Add all ingredients and toss well so every spinach leaf is coated. Leave to marinate for 15 minutes before serving.

Coconut & Ginger Mushrooms
2 tbsp coconut oil, ghee or olive oil
500 g (4 cups) mixed mushroom, we used shiitake, oyster and brown mushroom
3 tbsp grated fresh ginger
3 tbsp shredded coconut
2 tbsp soy sauce
1/2 lime, juice

Prepare the fresh mushrooms by simply wipe them off with a damp paper towel (do not wash them with water, as they will only absorb the liquid and get mushy when cooked). Slice the mushrooms in large bite-size pieces. In a large frying pan, heat oil or ghee, then add mushrooms.  Add the mushrooms, toss a couple times to coat them in oil. Add ginger, coconut and soy sauce. Cook for a couple minutes, and shake pan and leave to fry gently for 5-7 minutes. When the mushrooms have browned nicely, add a knob of coconut oil or ghee and the lime juice, and toss again so everything is mixed.
